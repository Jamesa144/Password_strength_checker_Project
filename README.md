This is the start of my machine learning where I use the data set provided by AIOscience.com to create a model. This model can check if an enter password is strong, medium or weak.

Some things I noticed in my first attempt is that running the training can take a bit of time with a large data set on my computer. I counter this by max out the number of tests it does but the accuracy 
is low for actual use but works for proof of concept the model works.
